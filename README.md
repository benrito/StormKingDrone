This piece is an interactive tour of the museum. 

It provides a bird's-eye view of the museum and then allows the user to zoom in five different pieces of the park. 

The site begins with an introductory interview/presentation with the director of the museum, David Collens.

When the user clicks on any of the five pieces, a one min. video (shot with the Phantom) of the piece will play. Such video would provide a 360Â° perspective of the piece, from different heights.
